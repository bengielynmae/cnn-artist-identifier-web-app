## cnn-artist-identifier-web-app
A web application for a painting / artist classifier using convolutional neural networks. The model weights used in this project is based on [github.com/SupratimH/DeepArtist's](https://github.com/SupratimH/applying-ml-use-cases/tree/master/DeepArtist-Identify-Artist-From-Art) work. However, the implementation and deployment of the model to a web application was done by me.
